# Bag_type
  Implement the types using classes. Represent the types using sequences of same-type
elements (List<> in C#).
  Create a main program with a menu to demonstrate the services (all the methods) a class
provides in arbitrary order (based on the selections of the user). Make the main program
instantiate an object of the class. The methods of the class can be called through the menu
items. Print the state of the object either after the completion of each menu item or through
another menu item for printing. If there are methods or friend functions that need multiple
objects (like adding two matrices, for example), the main program should make it possible to
create and print these objects through the menu.
  Implement unit tests which should be run automatically.
  Implement the bag type which contains integers. Represent the bag as a sequence of
(element, frequency) pairs. Implement as methods: inserting an element, removing an
element, returning the frequency of an element, returning the most frequent element
from the bag (suggestion: store the most frequent element and update it when the bag
changes), printing the bag. Lecture code cannot be submitted.
